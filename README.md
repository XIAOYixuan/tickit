# tickit
The product of getting bored with all those todo list\calendar\management app.

A highly overfitted CLI todo program --> so if you find out this repo accidenlty, it might not suit you.

One evening when I was rescheduling my todo on jira, I suddently got bored. Jira is cool, aber it's painfully slow. And for some IDK reasons, the calendar didn't show up in my project, so I was using a third-party issue calendar.
I've been using it for weeks, and gradually ran out of patience. e.g. Everytime I created a new todo, I couldn't bind it to an epic at the same time. I had to wait till it showed up in the calendar, then clicked on that issue again to add more details. 
Google calendar is also fine, but it's just a calendar. I want something a remix of calendar and todo, which can show the date and time, and I can tick it off when it's done. The action of "ticking sth off" is always satisfying.
I maybe spent a few seconds considering buying Notion. But after one or two glance at their fancy webpage, I gave up. 

Then the weekend was caming, I got nothing to do and this idea jumped into my head, why not do it yourself. I want sth simple, controllable, could add new functions whenever I need. And here it is.
